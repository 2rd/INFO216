How to use the Semantic Homicides application

Database setup:
	For a reduced database, that only includes homicides from 2015 and 2016,
	in addition to the demographic data:

		- Run Src/Main.java in Eclipse to create the reduced TDB database

	For the full database with all homicides 1976-2016:

		- download "tdb_full" from < https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bDTSJSnrQbQiEinEtik9X2RKy6vV4dQy?usp=sharing >


Run database:
	Run the database (either tdb_reduced or tdb_full) in Apache Fuseki as /ds with command line.


Open html/index.html to enter the basic interface.
	If the database is running on the server as /ds you should be able to explore visualizaions of pre-made queries,
	as well as running custom queries and visualize the results.
	
	note: on the "custom" page, the classes and properties are listed below.
